kotlinAndroidUtils

Diverse utils and extensions I end up using and reusing in my kotlin android apps.

`to` is defined in a weird way imho. `a to b to c` should be a triple `(a,b,c)`, not a "pairpair" `((a,b),c)`

Included is also specific `to3`, `to4` etc inline functions that transforms a Pair to a Triple, a Triple to a Quadruple etc
